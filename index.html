    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>

        <li> Boil the water:
            In a mediumsized saucepan, add 1 1/2 cups of water and bring it to a boil. You can use the quantity of
            water mentioned on the Maggi packet, but this amount is perfect for a good consistency.</li>

        <li> Add the noodles:
            Once the water comes to a boil, add the Maggi noodles. Break the noodle block into halves or keep it
            whole, depending on your preference. Stir it a little to separate the noodles.</li>

        <li> Add the tastemaker:
            After the noodles start to cook (about 2 minutes), add the Maggi tastemaker (the spice mix packet that comes
            with the noodles). Stir well to evenly coat the noodles with the seasoning.</li>

        <li> Add optional ingredients:
            If you want to make your Maggi more nutritious or flavorful, you can add chopped vegetables and let them
            cook with the noodles for about 23 minutes until they soften.
            If you're adding an egg, you can iether beat it and pour it into the boiling noodles to create a soft
            scrambled egg, or simply crack the egg into the noodles and let it cook for a few minutes until the egg
            whites
            are set.</li>

        <li>  Cook to your desired consistency:
            Cook the noodles for about 23 more minutes or until they reach your preferred consistencyâ€”whether you
            like it soupy or drier, adjust accordingly.</li>

        <li> Final touches:
            Once the noodles are cooked, you can add a pinch of chili powder or black pepper for extra heat. A
            squeeze of lemon juice adds a fresh tang, and chopped coriander leaves are a great garnish.</li>

        <li> Serve:
            Turn off the heat, stir everything well, and your delicious Maggi noodles are ready to be served!</li>
